# Python Application Documentation

This document provides instructions for setting up and running your Python application on Python 3.10. The application will be installed using a `requirements.txt` file and run on port 5000.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

1. Python 3.10 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. A `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary dependencies for your application.
3. The main Python application file (`app.py`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your Python application files are located.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv myenv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the application dependencies using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application:

1. Make sure you're still in the application's directory with the virtual environment activated.

2. Execute the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. The application will now start running on port 5000.

   - If you're running the application locally, you can access it at: `http://localhost:5000/`

   - If you're running the application on a remote server, replace `localhost` with the server's IP or hostname.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where it is running.

## Conclusion

This document provided the necessary instructions to install and run your Python application on Python 3.10. Make sure to update the `requirements.txt` file with any additional dependencies as needed.
